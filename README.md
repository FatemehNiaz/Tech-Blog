The idea is to create a  Tech Blog site so all the developers who are daily creating Apps, deploying their projects and debugging the codes can share their experience and ideas by posting them to the this Tech Blog and other developers can share their opinions and experiences on those subject by commenting.

This Tech Blog site which is built based upon CMV-style, so that developers can share their ideas, experiences about technical concepts, new technologies and recent advancements by posting their blog post and commenting on other developers' posts.

This application's architectural structure should follow the MVC paradigm (Model, view & Controller) and Sequeliza as the ORM. This application also uses the express-session npm package for the authentication and for the templateing language it is using the Handlebars.js.
